This jar is meant to be used with a multi-vm setup.

1. pfsense vm that acts as the gateway for all of the VMs.
This VM should be configured such
- it acts as a DHCP server
- it blocks all un-whitelisted traffic  
- it is especially importantly to not allow the wx vm to make dns queries via anything but the dnsmasq vm

2. linux vm with dnsmasq that acts as a dns server for all of the vms
- if you don't have another vm that you want to use to control the pfsense vm may want to give this one a gui.
- add a rule that converts all dns queries to an invalid ip (wildcard is #)
-- manually add the dns queries to whatever hostnames you want to allow

3. windows vm
- I used it to play games so I set-up a pci passthrough ( https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=212692 )
